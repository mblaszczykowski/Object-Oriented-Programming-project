# Object-oriented-programming-project
> Final project for Object Oriented Programming subject in C++

#### The main goal of this project was to use all of Object Oriented Programming principles and mechanisms and create an UML class diagram.

## Task:
Describe any selected part of reality with classes (min. 10) and implement relationships between them. Classes should have attributes and methods that change the state of objects. Invoke objects and call their methods. Add destructors and constructors and methods with this pointers.

Build a friendship mechanism between 7 classes, using private class fields and methods, in addition, for 5 classes add one friend function.

Add 5 classes to the existing design, overriding the existing classes, building at least four levels of hierarchy. Superior classes should have their own attributes and methods, shared with derived classes. 

Extend the project with 5 generic classes (can be a separate file).

In the implemented project, add 4 abstract classes from which other classes will inherit.
Abstract classes should have virtual methods (min 5 per class), which in derived classes will have their own implementation. 

In the project completed so far, add at least 5 overloaded operators for your own classes.

Demonstrate the operation of the implemented mechanisms in the main function.

Describe with a UML class diagram the implemented design for all classes.
